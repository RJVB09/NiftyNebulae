# Nifty Nebulae
Welcome to the github repository of nifty nebulae.

NiftyNebulae claims to add good looking 3D volumetric nebulae to KSP. 
Planet modders are more than welcome to use these for their planet packs, as the stock system doesn't provide much reason for one. 
NiftyNebulae was inspired by the volumetric nebulae seen in games such as SpaceEngine or Elite Dangerous. It uses roughly the same techniques as them.

This is my first actual kerbal space program plugin. I made the shader in Unity before, the real challenge in this case was the KSP implementation. 
Special thanks to RidiculeAmuser for helping me with a few things, Linx for letting me use the assetloader code of parralax and ofcourse all the people on google and stack exchange XD.
